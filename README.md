This playbook will allow the users to work on Eucalyptus deployments faster, focusing on the needs to change variables directly in the playbook file for each step of Eucalyptus deployment. This aim to give more possibilities in the deployment of Eucalyptus in order to test it, for QA.

All-in-one
----------

This playbook aims to make things simple for a non-advanced user, with a signle vars_files to update. This will allow any user to consider Eucalyptus deployment as just one single task, to then deploy anything on it, like a CI environment, or any applications. This will also give the opportunity to focus on services testing of Eucalyptus for QA.
